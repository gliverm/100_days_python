# 100_days_python

Simple collection of python code explored.  Using a Docker file to keep it a bit more portable.

### Prerequisites

* GIT
* Docker
* Visual Studio Code IDE

### How to bring up Development Environment

1. From a new VSCode window open the project.
2. VSCode should ask to re-open project in a container.  If not click on lower left green corner to re-open in a container.
3. After the container is up select the python interpreter.  More than likely the recommended value is highlighted.  If not close down the VSCode window and re-open in the container.

### 100 Days Journal

1. Docker environment up and running with working Hello World to verify operation.  My requirements: figure out how to install python from deadsnakes as different version that Ubuntu distro.  Yep using a Python image would have done it but I like to mix 3rd party sometimes.

2. Started reviewing PI Python Esssentials - reminder of the basics

3. Messing with print statements using the arrow lab.

4.
